## 1. Project Overview
Target is a globally recognized brand and a leading retailer in the United States, renowned for offering exceptional value, inspiration, innovation, and an outstanding guest experience. This project focuses on Target's operations in Brazil, analyzing 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018 using SQL.

The objective of this analysis is to leverage SQL to uncover patterns and trends within the data, offering valuable insights into Target's business operations in Brazil. These insights will inform strategies related to order processing efficiency, pricing, payment methods, shipping logistics, and customer satisfaction.

## 2. Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import and Exploration:**
   - Use SQL queries to import the dataset into a relational database management system (RDBMS).
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries to understand the data structure, relationships between tables, and key characteristics of the dataset.

2. **Operational Analysis:**
   - Write SQL queries to analyze the order processing timeline, including order approval, shipping, and delivery times.
   - Evaluate payment methods and their impact on order processing times and customer satisfaction through SQL aggregations and joins.
   - Assess freight performance and its correlation with customer location, order value, and delivery efficiency using SQL filters and grouping functions.

3. **Customer Analysis:**
   - Use SQL to examine customer demographics, including location and purchase behavior.
   - Query product categories to determine popular items and their pricing strategies.
   - Evaluate customer satisfaction through SQL analysis of review scores and comments, identifying key factors influencing positive and negative feedback.

4. **Modeling and Prediction (Optional):**
   - While SQL is primarily used for querying and analyzing data, basic predictive insights can be generated using SQL CASE statements, conditional logic, and aggregations to identify trends and patterns.

5. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Generate data-driven insights through SQL queries that highlight key findings related to operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and pricing strategies.
   - Formulate actionable recommendations based on SQL query results, suggesting potential improvements and areas for further analysis.

## 3. Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other RDBMS
- **SQL Queries:** For data extraction, transformation, and analysis
- **Visualization (Optional):** Use tools like Tableau or Power BI, connecting directly to the SQL database for visual analysis
- **Reporting:** Export query results for further analysis and presentation

## 4. Deliverables
- **SQL Scripts:** Collection of SQL scripts used for data analysis, including EDA, operational analysis, and customer behavior analysis.
- **Final Report:** A detailed report summarizing the analysis, key findings, and actionable recommendations for Target's operations in Brazil.
- **Presentation:** A summary of key insights and recommendations tailored for stakeholders.

## 5. Conclusion
This SQL-based project provides a comprehensive analysis of Target's operations in Brazil, using structured query language to extract valuable insights that can drive improvements in operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business strategy.
